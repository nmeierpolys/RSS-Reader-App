# RSS-Reader-App (Blogs, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
This is an aggregator of information from a variety of sources. The idea is to normalize information from blogs, twitter users, and facebook users. Whether you're reading an RSS feed of a blog, your Twitter timeline, or Facebook feed, there are always some people that post frequently, and some that post rarely. Those that post frequently overwhelm your feed and make it difficult to notice the content from those infrequent posters. The irony is that when an infrequent poster publishes something, the chances are that that single post is way more valuable than the firehose coming from a frequent poster.

This app seeks to balance out news coming from your various sources, bubbling up the most important pieces, and sampling just a subset of the content from those frequent posters. On top of that, the goal is to provide the user with ways to tell the app what is and isn't important. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have all started doing this on their own in algorithmic feeds, but we don't know what the logic behing those is, and don't have a chance to direct their algorithms. And chances are their algorithms are designed to serve their own needs and not necessarily our own.
